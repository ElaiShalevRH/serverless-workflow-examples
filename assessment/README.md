# Assessment workflow
The assessment workflow is used to perform some checks on user's input(s) and to return a list of suitable infrastructure workflows aka workflow options. 
Its common use case is to assess inputs (ie: a link to their project code and/or an application identifying code), and based on a logic determined by the enterprise returns a list of infrastructure workflows.

The goal in this example is to show how an assessment operation can be implemented in order to perform some check(s) on a user's input(s) and to return suitable workflow options.
